# ClassicPCA
 This exercise will implement the principal components analysis(PCA) using library for calculating eigenvalues and eigenvectors, used by PCA. After that, I've used the Iris dataset to analyse if PCA change significally, that is, if we execute the knn over iris dataset, before and after, will there be a difference.
