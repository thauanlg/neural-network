# CNN using the CIFAR-10 dataset

In this program has been implemented a cnn arquitecture to train and test the CIFAR-10 dataset. It's been used the mnist tutorial from tensorflow which gave us an idea of how to implement a acceptable cnn arquitecture. The pdf description provides the references and links to get the dataset and the tutorial.

Suggestions:

* The images obtained from the internet can be found in "images" directory. It can be used any type of images but in this work we are using just jpeg.
* The files referring to the trained models can be found in "save" directory.
* If you want to train or evaluate the models using the CIFAR dataset then it'll be necessary to download them from its website and put in the "cifar" dataset, which is empty here.
