# Classifiers(CNN) for MNIST dataset

This folder contains two scripts which will create some cnn classifiers and analyze them afterwards
The first script will create some classifiers for the mnist dataset using tensorflow cnn. Will be varied two parameters:
    - the number of features maps used in convolutional layer
    - the size of filters in convolution layer

The second will load the data saved about accuracy and time eleapsed of models, plotting some two graphics about them:
    - Accuracy variation by the numbers of convolution matrix and the size of each convolution matrix
    - Time eleapsed to training the model by the numbers of convolution matrix and the size of each convolution matrix
